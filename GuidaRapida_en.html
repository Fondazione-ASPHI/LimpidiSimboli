    <h1>🚀 Quick Guide: Your First Steps with Limpidi Simboli</h1>

    <h2>Introduction: Getting Started is Easy!</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the world of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)! "Limpidi Simboli" is a free web application, created by Fondazione ASPHI Onlus, to translate words into symbols, facilitating communication for people with cognitive disabilities or language difficulties.</p>
    <p>This guide will show you how to create and customize your first symbolic sentence in less than five minutes, with no complicated setup required. Are you ready? Let's start!</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Create Your First Sentence in Symbols</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Write a Sentence:</strong> Enter a simple sentence in the large text field you see at the top.</li>
        <li><strong>Translate!</strong>: Click the <strong>"🗣️ Translate"</strong> button (or just press Enter on your keyboard). You will immediately see your sentence transformed into a sequence of pictographic symbols from the ARASAAC library.</li>
        <li><strong>Want to hear how the sentence sounds?</strong> Click the <strong>"🔊 Listen"</strong> button to have the original sentence read aloud. This feature is very useful for reinforcing the connection between text, symbol, and sound, supporting learning and auditory comprehension.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Great! You've just created your first sentence in symbols. Now let's see how you can modify it to make it perfect for your needs.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Modify and Refine the Sentence</h2>
    <p>Sometimes the first symbol isn't the right one, or you want to make small adjustments. Here's how to customize your sentence quickly and easily.</p>

    <h3>2.1 Change a Symbol</h3>
    <p>If a symbol doesn't best represent the concept you want, the application offers alternatives.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click repeatedly on the symbol you want to change to browse the available options.</li>
        <li>Each click will show you a different option, if available.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Create or Upload Custom Images from Your PC</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the <strong>"📂 Select Image Folder"</strong> button</li>
        <li>Choose a folder on your PC where you want to save the images</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>"+"</strong> button on any symbol</li>
        <li>Upload an image from your computer
            <ul>
                <li>Images are saved to your disk (they don't take up browser memory)</li>
                <li>You can upload high-resolution images</li>
                <li>Images remain even after closing the browser</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>2.3 Search for a symbol on Wikipedia</h3>
    <p>Click the <strong>“W”</strong> button below a symbol. Search for images on Wikipedia: great for animals, places, famous people, scientific concepts. Not suitable for everyday actions.</p>

    <h3>2.4 Search with a Different Term</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the <strong>"🔍"</strong> button below the symbol</li>
        <li>Enter an alternative term (e.g., "heart" for "love")</li>
        <li>Choose from the symbol gallery</li>
        <li>The symbol is saved for future use with the new term.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>2.5 Remove a Symbol</h3>
    <p>Sometimes, for more direct communication, it's better to omit articles and prepositions. To remove a symbol you don't think is necessary, just click on <strong>“abc”</strong> and the symbol will disappear, replaced by the written word.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. Create a Unique Concept: Merge Symbols</h2>
    <p>This feature is perfect for representing complex ideas that require multiple words. By merging multiple symbols, you can create a single pictogram that expresses the complete concept.</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>What to Do</th>
                <th>Result</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1. Hold down the <strong>CTRL</strong> key on your keyboard and <strong>click on two or more symbols</strong>.</td>
                <td>The selected symbols will have a <strong>blue border</strong>.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2. A new button will appear. Click on <strong>"🔗 Merge"</strong>.</td>
                <td>The chosen symbols are fused into a single composite symbol.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>This feature is perfect for representing unique concepts formed by multiple words, like "bedroom" or actions like "go away".</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Congratulations and Next Steps</h2>
    <p>You are now fully capable of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>✅ Translating a sentence into symbols.</li>
        <li>✅ Refining each symbol (by changing or removing it).</li>
        <li>✅ Merging multiple symbols to create a unique concept.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although the application offers powerful customization tools, the skills you've just learned are the heart of symbolic communication and all you need to start creating and communicating effectively right now. Good job!</p>
